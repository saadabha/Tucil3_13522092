# Word Ladder Solver

## 🛸 Project Overview
Welcome to the repository for my ***Algorithm Strategy (IF2211)*** course project at Institut Teknologi Bandung. This project showcases my skills on implementing Uniform Cost Search (UCS), Greedy Best First Search (GBFS), and A* (A-star) algorithms in the Word Ladder game. In this project, UCS carefully navigating the Word Ladder graph by considering cumulative costs from the start word. GBFS, on the other hand, prioritizes nodes based on their similarity to the target word, using the Hamming distance heuristic. A* Search combines the strengths of UCS and GBFS, efficiently balancing cumulative costs and heuristic estimates to find the optimal solution.

## 📝 Requirements
* java version "22.0.1" 2024-04-16
* Java(TM) SE Runtime Environment (build 22.0.1+8-16)

## Setup
For Windows

- Go to the bin folder, then run

```
.\run.bat
```

For others operating system, compile and run the program manually

- Compile the program by running

```
javac -d bin src/*.java
```

- Go to the bin folder, run the program by running

```
java src/Main
```

## Usage
1. Input start sord
2. Input end word
3. Choose the algorithm
4. Click the Find Shortest Ladder button
5. Wait for the result
